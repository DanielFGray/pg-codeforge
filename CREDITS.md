codeforge is powered by the `pg-introspection` package from the Graphile suite, much of the ideas and inspiration for this are borrowed from [PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org/), and some bits of code have been borrowed from PostGraphile and the [starter kit](https://github.com/graphile/starter)

codeforge wouldn't be possible without the Graphile suite, and if you like this or depend on this program you should consider [sponsoring their work](https://github.com/sponsors/benjie#sponsors)
